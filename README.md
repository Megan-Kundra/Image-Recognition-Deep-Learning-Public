# Image-Recognition-Deep-Learning-Public
This application uses Deep Learning to classify images using computer vision and machine learning concepts. The deep learning models used were EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-18, and Vision Transformer (ViT) models. This pipeline runs on the CIFAR-10 dataset containing 60,000 32 x 32 color images, across 10 classes.

Specifics include:

Dataset preprocessing (dataset images are preprocessed by resizing to 224Ã—224 and normalizing with ImageNet statistics)
Model fine-tuning on 5,000 training samples
Running Inference on 1,000 test samples
Capturing training checkpoints for optimized model use in other applications
Model optimization
Data analysis on model performance and output
